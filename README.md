This Python script provides a simple yet secure way to manage your passwords locally. It utilizes encryption to store passwords securely. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme, ensuring that stored passwords are secure.

Data Management: The script allows you to add, retrieve, and delete passwords for various services.

Password Generation: You can generate strong passwords of custom lengths for new services.

Master Password: A master password is set up to access and manage the stored passwords. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

User Interaction: The script provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the password manager.

Features:
Adding a New Service: Users can add a new service along with its username and password.
Retrieving Passwords: Passwords for previously added services can be retrieved using the service name.
Generating Passwords: Users can generate strong, random passwords for new services.
Deleting Services: Users can delete stored passwords for services they no longer require.

How to Use:
Setup Master Password: If it's your first time using the script, you'll be prompted to set up a master password. This password is essential for accessing your stored passwords.
Main Menu: After setting up the master password, you'll be presented with a menu where you can choose various actions such as adding, retrieving, generating passwords, or deleting services.
Exiting: You can exit the script anytime by pressing CTRL+C.
